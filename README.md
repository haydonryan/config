# Linux Config Files

Create a directory in your home directory called .haydons-config, and clone the repository by using: 

``` 
# From ~ directory
git clone git@github.com:haydonryan/config.git ./haydons-config/
./haydons-config/link.sh
```

This will link the config files to the ones located in this directory.
