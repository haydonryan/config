# Linux Config Files
# NOTE MOVING TO GIT BARE REPOSITORY - This repository is depricated.


My common linux configuration files across ubuntu and ish for iOS.  Stores all configuration in ~/.haydons-config.  Clone the repository by using the following commands:

``` 
git clone git@github.com:haydonryan/config.git ~/.haydons-config/
# or 
git clone https://github.com/haydonryan/config.git ~/.haydons-config/
~/.haydons-config/link.sh
```

This will link the config files to the ones located in this directory.
